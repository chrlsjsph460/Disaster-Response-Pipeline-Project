## Description
 This project analyzes disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://appen.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. In this repository you'll find a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. A machine learning pipeline is created to categorize these events so that you can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency. This project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
